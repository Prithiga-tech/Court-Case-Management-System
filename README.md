# Court Case Management System

This is a simple front-end prototype for a **Court Case Management System**, developed as part of the **CSI1007: Software Engineering Principles** course.

- **Dashboard UI** (dashboard.html) with:
  - Total Cases
  - Pending Cases
  - Closed Cases
- Responsive layout using CSS Flexbox
